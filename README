Simple project to find anomalies in a data set using pandas. The dataset is Adventureworks,
one of the classic sets for learning data analysis. It simpulates a bicycle repair shop. It
contains enough tables and data to enable robust and interesting analysis, without being
overwhelming. It can be downloaded here: https://github.com/lorint/AdventureWorks-for-Postgres

This code was run on Python 3.9. Install needed packages with 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

The code analyzes the number of orders on different days to find those with unsually high or low
order counts. These are found using the standard Inter Quantile Range statistics filter method.
The results are written out in dates_unusual_sales.csv
